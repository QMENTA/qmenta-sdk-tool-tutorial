This repository contains the data, code, scripts and configuration files associated with the [Getting Started tutorial](https://docs.qmenta.com/sdk/getting_started.html) in the [QMENTA SDK documentation](https://docs.qmenta.com/sdk/) portal.

## Description

The tutorial helps you learn the foundations of using the QMENTA SDK and the technological ecosystem around it,
including Docker and the [QMENTA platform](https://client.qmenta.com/#/login).

As a case study, the tutorial goes partially over the [ANTs Tutorial](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy/blob/master/tutorials/10minTutorial.ipynb)
implementation. The implementation will allow the user to select which processing steps to perform and also select a
variety of parameters for segmenting the images.

Pyradiomics is an open-source Python package for the extraction of radiomic features from medical images.
